# SQL Project Portfolio
This repository contains a collection of SQL queries and analyses related to hotel management. The project covers various aspects such as bookings, revenue analysis, occupancy rates, and customer ratings.

## Project Overview
The project consists of SQL queries organized into different categories, each addressing a specific aspect of hotel management:

* Number of Bookings by Room Class:
  Utilizes aggregate functions to analyze the number of bookings per room class.

* Properties with Specified Ratings:
  Employs aggregate functions and filtering to identify properties with an average rating below a certain threshold.

* Stay Duration:
  Calculates stay durations using date functions.

* City-wise Average Hotel Occupancy: Utilizes aggregate functions and arithmetic operations to compute the average occupancy percentage for hotels in each city.

* Day of the Week with Highest Bookings in July: Uses date functions, filtering, and aggregation to determine the day of the week with the highest number of bookings in July.

* City-wise Revenue Realized: Applies aggregate functions, conditional logic, and arithmetic operations to calculate the total revenue realized by hotels in each city, considering cancelled bookings.

* Top Properties with Highest Ratings: Utilizes aggregate functions, ranking functions, and joins to list the top properties based on average ratings.

* Revenue for Each Month (Luxury Category): Utilizes aggregate functions, conditional logic, and date functions to calculate revenue for luxury hotels each month, considering different booking statuses.

* Month-on-Month Growth Rate: Utilizes window functions, arithmetic operations, and conditional logic to calculate the month-on-month growth rate in revenue for each property.

* Pivot Table: Revenue by Room Class: Generates a pivot table showing revenue breakdown by room class using aggregate functions and pivot operations.

* Ranking Top Revenue Properties: Employs aggregate functions, ranking functions, and joins to rank properties based on total revenue generated.

## Types of SQL Queries Used
The SQL queries in this project employ various SQL techniques, including:

-Aggregate functions
-Filtering and conditional logic
Date functions
Joins and relationships
Window functions
Pivot operations
Ranking functions
Each query is tailored to perform specific analyses or calculations based on the hotel management database schema.

Usage
Each SQL query is documented and can be directly executed against a compatible relational database management system (RDBMS). Simply copy and paste the query into your preferred SQL editor or environment.

Dataset
The queries are designed to work with a hypothetical hotel management database. The schema and data can be customized to fit specific requirements.
